# Loom Programming Langugage

Loom is a modern, compiled systems programming language designed to hit the sweet spot between low-level control and high-level saftey. My core philosophy is **Structured Freedom**: make the safe, high-performance path the most ergonomic one, while providing clear, explicit escape hatches for when you need to talk directly to the metal.

It's a language for building reliable, concurrent, and efficient software without the steep learning curve of a borrow checker or the legacy complexities of C++.

# Current Status
Loom is currently in design phase. I am plannign out syntax, development workflow and more. THe first stage, the lexer is in progress,
