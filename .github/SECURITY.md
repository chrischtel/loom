## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Loom programming language team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/chrischtel/loom/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Loom team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Security Update Process

When a security issue is reported, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems  
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release new versions as soon as possible
5. Announce the security fix in the release notes
